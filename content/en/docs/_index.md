These docs will guide you to set up your own cookbook website. 

## What Is This?

This documentation is for a Hugo theme that is designed to show recipes. Hugo is
a static website generator that merges content files with a theme. More information 
about Hugo can be found at [https://gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/).

This theme makes use of the Hugo front matter in content files to define recipe
ingredients and steps in a structured way. This will be transformed by Hugo with
this theme into a styled recipe page.
